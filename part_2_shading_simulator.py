# AGROVOLTAIC SIMULATION - PART 2: PV SYSTEM & SHADING SIMULATOR
# =================================================================
# This script reads the environment data from Part 1, adds a single-axis
# tracking PV system, and calculates the resulting hourly shadow and
# average ground-level irradiance for the entire year.

# --- Step 0: Import necessary libraries ---
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pvlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("Libraries imported successfully.")

# --- Step 1: Define Inputs ---
# 1a. Input File

row_spacing = 6.0  # We will test a single pitch of 6.0m as per the plan

print(f"Starting Part 2: Simulating PV system with a {row_spacing}m pitch.")

# --- Step 2: Load Environment Data ---

    # This method reads the index as text, converts it to a proper UTC datetime,
    # and then localizes it to the correct timezone. This avoids all previous errors.

# --- Step 3: Calculate Single-Axis Tracking with Backtracking ---

# The Ground Coverage Ratio (GCR) is key for backtracking. It's the ratio of panel width to row spacing.
gcr = panel_width / row_spacing

# while adjusting the angle to avoid casting a shadow on the next row.

# --- Step 4: Simulate Hourly Shading ---

    # Project the shadow from these two edges onto the ground (the x-axis)
    # The shadow's position depends on the sun's angle in the sky (azimuth)
    shadow_x1 = x1 - y1 / np.tan(sun_ele + 1e-6) * np.sin(sun_azi - np.radians(axis_azimuth-180))

# --- Step 5: Calculate Average Ground Irradiance ---

# Convert GHI and DHI to numpy arrays for faster calculation
ghi = df['GHI (W/m2)'].to_numpy()[:, np.newaxis]
dhi = df['DHI (W/m2)'].to_numpy()[:, np.newaxis]

# The irradiance at any point is DHI if shaded, and GHI if not.
# GHI = DNI*cos(zenith) + DHI. So, if a point is shaded, it loses the DNI component.
ground_irradiance = dhi + (ghi - dhi) * (1 - is_shaded)

# Calculate the average across the entire ground surface for each hour
df['Avg GHI Agrivoltaic (W/m2)'] = ground_irradiance.mean(axis=1)
